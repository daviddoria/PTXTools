Coordinate System
-----------------
This code was developed with the Leica HDS3000 scanner in mind. The coordinate system is:

Z = up (a raw coming out the top of the scanner). From this, we refer to increasing z as increasing "phi"
The direction moving from the +Y axis towards the +X axis is increasing "theta".

Note: These terms (particularly phi) may not correspond to the terms used in standard coordinate systems.
For example, "phi" is usually measured from +Z. Therefore, some more general code (i.e. in Helpers)
may not use the same coordinate system as the scanner defines.

The origin (0,0) of the PTX image is the bottom left corner of the scan (the first point acquired in a
"bottom to top, left to right" scan).
